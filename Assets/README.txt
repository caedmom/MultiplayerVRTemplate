The network example currently uses Unity matchmaking to connect instances of the game. If you would like to create your own based on the template, configure Multiplayer service by following the instructions on this link:

The network behavior of the sample scene connects players automatically using the matchmaking service. If you would like to change this, you will have to modify the NetworkManager object in the scene.
